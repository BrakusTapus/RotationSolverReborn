/// On next frame (+10ms), cooldown will be reduced and clamped to 0, action will be executed and it's cooldown set to X ms - so next time it can be pressed at X+10 ms.
/// If we were running with infinite fps, cooldown would be reduced to 0 and action would be executed slightly (5ms) earlier.
/// We can't fix that easily, but at least we can fix the cooldown after action execution - so that next time it can be pressed at X+5ms.
/// We do that by reducing actual cooldown by difference between previously-remaining cooldown and frame delta, if action is executed at first opportunity.
